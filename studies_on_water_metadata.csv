;;;;;;;
;2. More than the minimum mention of funding with either a sub-title that includes “finances/funding/economics” or clear discussion of some key issues such as “full pricing” ”cost recovery” and other economic terms.;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
;3. Clear interest in funding/finances with economic jargon present, but it’s not the only key topics. Keywords may be in sub-titles and even heading of some chapters.;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
;4. Central role for funding/finances, but not as overt and clear as number 5. ;;;;;;
;;;;;;;
;5. Primarily about funding mechanisms, other topics are secondary. Predominant economic jargon including keywords such as 3T, pricing, finance, private sector, economic, benefits. Frequent use of numbers/numerical values. ;;;;;;
